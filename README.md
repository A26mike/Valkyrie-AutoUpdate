This Python Script is a Semi-Automated way to update Arma 3 Workshop mods quickly. After Completing this version a modifiable completely automated version will be completed with a config file to allow for easy use in different environments. The idea behind this to run on a schedule and limit the amount of overhead needed when administering an Arma 3 server. Paired with a script to auto shutdown and restart the server you could, in essence, automate a large chunk of administration.
